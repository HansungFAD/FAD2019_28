**Model Name : Hollowed Sphere/Torus Model**<br>
**Model Contributors : 손준호 AND 유승용**<br>
**Model Details :**<br>
The shape of designated virtual planet is supposed to be symmetrical by the axis. If not, gravitational energy on the surface of the planet would not balance and eventually cause the planetoid to break down, making life on it very scarce.<br>
The planet rotates - as the rotation provides energy from the star of the system all over the surface.<br>
**Model Possibility :**<br>
This planet is speculated to be consisting of fluid, and at least 30% of it would be liquid water.<br>
This planet would exist outside of the Roche Limit. The Roche Limit is a distance between a planetoid and its satelite, and it applies to a planetoid and its star as well. A planet outside of the Roche Limit of the star of the system could withstand its tidal force.<br>
The material forming this planet needs to be heavy and elastic enough to hold itself.<br>
If the planet is to be heavy than the Earth, it needs to be farther than the Earth is to the Sun.<br>
Considering above parameters, this planet wolud be stable enough to exist.<br>
**Consideration for Designated Model :**<br>
The planet would collect energy from the energy radiated by the star.<br>
Also, the planet could collect tidal energy of the planet itsef.<br>
Planetary gravitational energy is also subject to collection. Shift in the axis of rotation would give off energy to collect if the planet is shaped as a torus.<br>
Calander used on this planet would use Solar iteration.<br>
A year would be measured with the shift of the rotation axis reverting back to its original state, whatever that state could be.<br>

**Model Name : Tetrahedron Model**<br>
**Model Contributors : 이준구 AND 이찬희**<br>
**Model Details :**<br>
In order to keep its mass-electromagentic balance intact, the model consists of a tetrahedron which has approximately the same mass and density of that of the Earth. Since this planetoid and the Earth has the same volume, we can speculate that a single side of the tetrahedron would be 2x10^7 kilometres.<br>
**Model Possibility :**<br>
Such shape would collapse into a semi-sphere via gravitational forces, and this model would not last as a tetrahedron for eterity. The tetrahedron shape could possibly naturally form, as the formation of a planet involves gathering of asteroidal chunks of minerals. As the mass of each particle considered reduce, the shape of the sum of the parts could be out of the gravitational 'mold' of sphere.
<br>
**Consideration for Designated Model :**<br>
The collapse mentioned above would provide thermal and mechanical energy to the system of this planetary model. Such energy could be calculated by integration of each particles of the planetoid shifting.<br>
The planet would collect energy from the star at the center of the system.<br>
Calander used on this planet would use Solar iteration.<br>
A year would be measured with the revolution cycle of the planet.<br>
