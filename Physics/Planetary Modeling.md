Models themselves and their details are documented with the format below :

**Model Details :**<br>
The shape of designated virtual planet is supposed to be symmetrical by the axis. If not, gravitational energy on the surface of the planet would not balance and eventually cause the planetoid to break down, making life on it very scarce.<br>
The planet rotates - as the rotation provides energy from the star of the system all over the surface.<br>
**Model Possibility :**<br>
This planet is speculated to be consisting of fluid, and at least 30% of it would be liquid water.<br>
This planet would exist outside of the Roche Limit. The Roche Limit is a distance between a planetoid and its satelite, and it applies to a planetoid and its star as well. A planet outside of the Roche Limit of the star of the system could withstand its tidal force.<br>
The material forming this planet needs to be heavy and elastic enough to hold itself.<br>
If the planet is to be heavy than the Earth, it needs to be farther than the Earth is to the Sun.<br>
Considering above parameters, this planet wolud be stable enough to exist.<br>
**Consideration for Designated Model :**<br>
The planet would collect energy from the energy radiated by the star.<br>
Also, the planet could collect tidal energy of the planet itsef.<br>
Planetary gravitational energy is also subject to collection. Shift in the axis of rotation would give off energy to collect if the planet is shaped as a torus.<br>
Calander used on this planet would use Solar iteration.<br>
A year would be measured with the shift of the rotation axis reverting back to its original state, whatever that state could be.<br>
